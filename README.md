# Hi, I'm TsaiTung (Samantha) Chiang 👋  
**Materials & Biomedical Engineering | Materials Characterization | Biomaterials & Device Concepts**

I’m a materials-focused biomedical engineering graduate based in Toronto, with hands-on experience in:

- **SEM/EDS characterization** (Hitachi SU3500 & SU7000)
- **Biomaterials & hydrogel systems**
- **Smart materials** (SMP, SMA, piezoelectric, dielectric elastomers)
- **Material structure–property relationships**
- Early-stage **medical device concept development**

This GitHub showcases my engineering notes, material characterization workflows, and ongoing learning projects as I build my career in **materials engineering, medical devices, and R&D support roles**.

## 🔬 Technical Interests
- Materials characterization (SEM/EDS, morphology, microstructure)
- Soft materials & hydrogels
- Device material integration
- Composites & functional materials
- Material behavior under mechanical/chemical influence

## 📁 Repositories (coming soon)
- **SEM Activated Carbon Project**
- **Wound Dressing Engineering Notes**
- **Smart Materials Study Notes**
- **Engineering Tools Learning (SolidWorks, COMSOL)**
