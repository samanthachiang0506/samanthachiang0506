Hi, I'm TsaiTung (Samantha) Chiang   
Materials & Device Engineering | R&D, Materials Characterization, Manufacturing & Quality | UofT MSE Graduate

I’m a materials-oriented biomedical engineering graduate based in Toronto, with hands-on experience across materials characterization, soft materials, and early-stage device concepts. My work often sits at the intersection of **material behavior, microscopy, and functional design**.

My technical experience includes:
- **SEM/EDS characterization** using Hitachi SU3500 & SU7000  
- **Hydrogels & soft materials**, including GelMA/HA and pH-responsive systems  
- **Smart materials** (SMPs, SMAs, piezoelectrics, dielectric elastomers)  
- **Structure–property relationships** in polymers and composites  
- **Early concept development** for material-integrated medical devices

This GitHub is where I organize my engineering notes, project documentation, and learning progress as I continue building toward roles in **materials engineering, medical device R&D, and lab-based characterization**.

### Technical Interests
